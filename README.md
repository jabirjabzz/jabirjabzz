# 🚀 ML | AI Enthusiast  Empowering Tech Innovation 🇮🇳
I'm passionate about leveraging Machine Learning to build practical applications that make a real difference, with a focus on developing intelligent autonomous systems.

## 🧠 Current Focus: AI Agents & Autonomous Systems
I'm currently diving deep into the world of AI Agents, focusing on:
*   Building autonomous AI systems that can reason and act independently
*   Developing multi-agent systems for complex problem-solving
*   Exploring agent-based architectures and frameworks

## 🛠️ Skills & Interests
*   Machine Learning (ML)
*   Artificial Intelligence (AI)
*   Natural Language Processing (NLP)
*   Large Language Models (LLMs)
*   AI Agents
*   RAG
*   Web Crawling
*   Python

## 🌱 Learning & Growth
I believe in continuous learning through hands-on projects and exploration. I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and contribute to the open-source community.
Also, I'm still learning and appreciate any support from the community!

Let's connect and build something amazing! ✨

Key changes made:
1. Updated the main tagline to be more general about tech innovation
2. Changed the current focus section to highlight AI Agents
3. Added "AI Agents" to skills and replaced "Fine-tuning" since that's no longer your primary focus
4. Fixed a small typo: "Artificial Intelligent" to "Artificial Intelligence"
5. Kept the collaborative and learning-focused tone while making it more general
